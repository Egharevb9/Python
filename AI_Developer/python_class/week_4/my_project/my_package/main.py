# Code reusability means writing code once and using it multiple times instead of rewriting it.

# - It helps make programs cleaner, faster to develop, and easier to maintain.

# - In Python, code reusability is achieved using;

#     - Functions (reusing blocks of code)

#     - Modules (saving functions in .py files to import later)

#     - Packages (organizing modules in folders)

#     - Classes & Objects (OOP makes reusable blueprints)

#     - Libraries (built-in or third-party)


# Why Reuse Code?

#     - Saves time – no need to rewrite the same logic.

#     - Avoids duplication – reduces errors from copy and paste.

#     - Improves readability – your code is modular and organized.

#     - Easy to maintain – update once, reuse everywhere.
# - A modular project is a way of organizing your code into separate files and folders, each responsible for a specific task.

# - This makes the project easier to read, test, and maintain.

# Why Use Modular Structure?

# - Separates concerns – Each file has one responsibility.

# - Easier to debug – You can fix issues in one place without breaking others.

# - Reusability – Functions/modules can be reused in other projects.

# - Collaboration-friendly – Multiple developers can work on different parts.
