# Basic usage of print()
print("hello, world!")
print("welcome to python programming.")
name = "Aisha"
age = 25


# using print() with variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)


# using f-strings with print()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} score {score} in the exam.")



#using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "lovelace"
print("full name: " + first_name + " " + last_name)


# comma vs concatenation 
print("hello", "world!")  # with cooma
print("hello" + " " + "world!")# with concatenation
